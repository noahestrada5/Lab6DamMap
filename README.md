# Lab6Dammap
This is code for a map that highlights the high risk of dams of North Carolina and their current condition. I got these data points from the [National Inventory of Dams](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/). I completed this as a part of a lab project for web mapping. I am not very happy with the turnout with respect to the choropleth. I originally planned on using dam data from USGS. And until about a day before this assignment was due, I realized the data set was a little big (a few thousand data points). Nevertheless, I made do with the current data set loaded on to it. I do not see a problem with any components other than the choropleth feature. In the web map itself, you can click on any point to display the dam name. Looking at the map itself, conditions of high risk dams are relatively poor and/or not even rated.
